    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a no-bake pudding dessert that's so quick and easy to
      make--everyone loves it. I always keep the ingredients on hand in case I
      need a quick dessert. It's best if it sits overnight before serving.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 individual packages graham crackers</li>
      <li>2 (3 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
      <li>3 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package prepared chocolate frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan with graham crackers.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and milk; stir well. Mix whipped
      topping into pudding mixture. Spread half of mixture over graham cracker
      layer. Top with another layer of graham crackers and the remaining
      pudding.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Top all with a final layer of graham crackers and frost with chocolate
      frosting. Refrigerate at least two hours before serving to allow the
      graham crackers to soften.
    </ol>
